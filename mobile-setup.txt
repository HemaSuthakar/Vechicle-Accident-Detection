MOBILE SETUP GUIDE - HTTPS Required for Sensors
================================================

PROBLEM: HTTP doesn't allow sensor access on mobile browsers.
SOLUTION: Use one of these methods:

METHOD 1: Using ngrok (Recommended - Easiest)
----------------------------------------------
1. Download ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Extract to any folder
3. Open Command Prompt in that folder
4. Run: ngrok http 80
5. Copy the HTTPS URL (like: https://abc123.ngrok.io)
6. Open that URL on your mobile + add /VAD/
   Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/VAD/

METHOD 2: Using localhost on Android Chrome
--------------------------------------------
1. Use USB cable to connect phone to PC
2. Enable USB Debugging on Android
3. Open Chrome on PC: chrome://inspect
4. Click "Port forwarding"
5. Add: Port 80 -> localhost:80
6. On phone, open: http://localhost/VAD/
   (localhost is treated as secure origin)

METHOD 3: Self-signed Certificate (Advanced)
---------------------------------------------
Run setup-https.bat as administrator
Then access: https://172.3.4.18/VAD/
(You'll need to accept the security warning)

RECOMMENDED: Use Method 1 (ngrok) for quickest setup!
